# Nexter Project

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!  
by Jonas Schmedtmann  

The Nexter (on-line real estate sales website) project is an exercise in creating a single-page, responsive web-app using advanced HTML, CSS, SASS and node.js for it's development.  It was designed by the course instructor for demonstrating the use of CSS GRID in positioning elements on a web page.

This repo contains my most recent version of this website. In the homes section I sought to provide some functionality to the cards which allowed them to be flipped (by clicking the button @ the bottom of each card). The card "flip" was accomplished using a click-event coded with jquery. Hover events were added in the gallery section and a scroll-down effect added (again with jquery) to the View Properties button.

The Chrome browser does not properly render the SVGs when nested within the "use" tag as has been
done here. I prefer using this method as it allows for agile styling of the SVGs using CSS as opposed
to inline styling of the individual SVGs themselves. For this reason use of the Firefox browser is
recommended.

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Inkscape 0.92 for svg creation
- Codepen for testing grid layouts and various other ideas
